# Minimalistic deep learning package for Matlab
This code is useful for toying with ideas and trying them quickly in Matlab. It is designed to be similar to [Torch NN](https://github.com/torch/nn) package, but of course it lacks lot of modules. I didn't include convolutional layers because they are slow on Matlab anyway. Try running demo codes.
